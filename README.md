# Patrick-Hennessey-Task-Board

## Description 

This project is a simple task board application that allows the management of multiple tasks. It runs on a browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS using jQuery. It also uses Day.js for dates. The task board contains three columns representing the current status of a task: To Do, In Progress, and Done. Furthermore, each task is color-coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline or overdue. Additionally, each task is saved in local storage to ensure the tasks remain intact if the user leaves and returns to the web page. Finally, the user can drag and drop tasks between each status column and remove tasks using the corresponding delete button. 

This project was difficult. Although some features were easy to implement, like the modal dialogue box and color coding tasks, others proved much more difficult, such as the drag-and-drop function. In fact, getting the drag-and-drop to function properly took much trial and error and research to implement. 

I learned a lot in implementing this project. I had never used jQuery or Dayjs before for a project, and I found their functionality intuitive and efficient. Local storage took some time to get a hang of, but it was doable once I learned the syntax. The drag-and-drop function is where I struggled and learned the most, although I am far from being comfortable with it.
